# CDN Fallbacks and Error Handling

MapLibreum now includes robust CDN fallback mechanisms and error handling to ensure maps display properly even when external resources are blocked or unavailable.

## Problem Addressed

Previously, MapLibre maps depended on external CDN resources from unpkg.com. When these CDNs were blocked (common in corporate environments, content blockers, or network restrictions), maps would fail completely, showing blank pages with no indication of what went wrong.

## Solution Implemented

### Multi-CDN Fallbacks

Maps now attempt to load MapLibre GL JS from multiple CDNs in sequence:

1. **Primary**: unpkg.com (fastest, most reliable)
2. **Secondary**: cdn.jsdelivr.net (jsDelivr CDN)  
3. **Tertiary**: cdnjs.cloudflare.com (Cloudflare CDN)

### Graceful Error Handling

When all CDNs fail to load, maps now display a user-friendly error message instead of a blank page:

```
üó∫Ô∏è
Map Loading Error
Failed to load MapLibre GL JavaScript library

This may be due to network restrictions or CDN availability issues.
Try refreshing the page or check your internet connection.
```

### CSS Fallbacks

CSS resources also include fallback mechanisms to ensure styling works across different CDN availability scenarios.

## Technical Implementation

The solution includes:

- **Asynchronous CDN Loading**: Progressive fallback through multiple CDN providers
- **Error Detection**: Automatic detection of CDN loading failures  
- **Styled Error Messages**: Professional, informative error displays
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear communication when technical issues occur
- **Try-Catch Protection**: Robust error handling around map initialization

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Improved Reliability**: Maps work even when primary CDN is blocked  
‚úÖ **Better UX**: Clear error messages instead of confusing blank pages  
‚úÖ **Professional Appearance**: Styled error states maintain visual consistency  
‚úÖ **Debugging Aid**: Console logging helps identify specific CDN issues  
‚úÖ **Deployment Ready**: Works reliably in various hosting environments  

## Backward Compatibility

This enhancement is fully backward compatible. Existing code continues to work unchanged, with the added benefit of improved reliability and error handling.

## Testing

Comprehensive tests ensure the fallback mechanisms work correctly:

```bash
pytest tests/test_cdn_fallbacks.py -v
```

The test suite validates:
- Multi-CDN fallback implementation
- Error handling functionality  
- CSS fallback mechanisms
- Map initialization error handling
- Styled error message display
- Preservation of normal map functionality

# Next Steps for JavaScript Injection Reduction - October 14, 2025

## üéØ Current Status

After completing the tracking audit (see [PROGRESS_REPORT_2025_10_09_TRACKING_AUDIT.md](PROGRESS_REPORT_2025_10_09_TRACKING_AUDIT.md)), the roadmap is now accurate:

- **Overall Progress**: 69.1% (85/123 examples)
- **Phase 1**: 48.0% (12/25 examples)
- **Phase 2**: 100% (15/15 examples)
- **Phase 3**: 13.6% (3/22 examples)

## üöÄ Recommended Path Forward

### Priority 1: Ship Protocol & Deck.GL Conversions (high-impact backlog)

**Target Examples**:
- `pmtiles-source-and-protocol`
- `toggle-deckgl-layer`
- `use-addprotocol-to-transform-feature-properties`

**Why This Matters:**
- Unlocks modern PMTiles delivery and protocol extension stories demanded by data-heavy workflows
- Demonstrates that the new `DeckGLLayer` stack can support dynamic toggling without manual JavaScript
- Establishes a reusable protocol-extension interface that Phase 3 examples can build upon
- Raises overall completion by ~2.4 percentage points once all three land

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. **PMTilesProtocol / PMTilesSource**: register PMTiles handlers from Python and expose friendly configuration hooks
2. **DeckGLLayer.toggle() support**: expose deck.gl layer lifecycle controls and pair them with a `LayerToggleControl`
3. **ProtocolExtension & FeatureTransformer APIs**: surface `map.addProtocol()` equivalents with validation and transform callbacks

**Estimated Effort**: Medium-High (collectively 6-9 engineering days)
- Protocol registration requires async-safe resource loading and cache management
- Deck.GL toggling must coordinate with existing layer management abstractions
- Protocol extensions need guardrails to prevent unsafe JavaScript execution

**Test Files**:
- `tests/test_examples/test_pmtiles_source_and_protocol.py`
- `tests/test_examples/test_toggle_deckgl_layer.py`
- `tests/test_examples/test_use_addprotocol_to_transform_feature_properties.py`

**Current Implementation**: Direct JavaScript hooks (`map.addProtocol`, manual Deck.GL toggles) executed through `add_on_load_js()` with no Python visibility.

**Improvement Goal**: Provide first-class Python APIs for registering protocols, wiring deck.gl toggles, and applying feature transforms so notebooks never need custom injection for these workflows.

### Priority 2: Complete Drawing Tool Wrappers

**Target Examples**:
- `draw-geometries-with-terra-draw`
- `draw-polygon-with-mapbox-gl-draw`

**Why This Matters:**
- Finishes the outstanding third-party drawing integrations in Phase 3
- Establishes a common drawing-tool abstraction that subsequent geospatial editing features can reuse
- Eliminates the final external-library dependencies that still require raw script tags

**Implementation Requirements:**
1. **TerraDrawWrapper**: manage lifecycle, mode switching, and event callbacks for Terra Draw
2. **MapboxDrawWrapper / PolygonDrawTool**: expose shape editing, styling, and export helpers for Mapbox GL Draw
3. Shared **DrawingTools** base class: unify enable/disable semantics and event propagation

**Estimated Effort**: Medium (4-6 engineering days combined)
- Both libraries require bundling assets and mapping their event systems into Python callbacks
- Need robust serialization helpers so tests can assert drawn geometry without browser interaction

**Test Files**:
- `tests/test_examples/test_draw_geometries_with_terra_draw.py`
- `tests/test_examples/test_draw_polygon_with_mapbox_gl_draw.py`

**Current Implementation**: Adds external scripts and inline JavaScript to register drawing tools and emit geometry events.

**Improvement Goal**: Deliver Python-native drawing APIs that configure the tools, surface draw events, and serialize results directly to notebook outputs.

### Priority 3: Raise Phase 1 Completion (13 examples remaining)

Phase 1 still has 13 JavaScript-injection-first demos that rely on `add_on_load_js()` for navigation, pointer inspection, or bespoke UI toggles.

**Focus Areas:**
- Harden the navigation utilities (`Map.fly_to`, `Map.ease_to`, sequencing helpers) so every tutorial-level map interaction is injection-free
- Standardize pointer feedback patterns (hover tooltips, feature-inspection popups) with reusable event handlers
- Provide lightweight control factories for any lingering checkbox/button demos that still wire DOM listeners manually

**Why This Matters:**
- Completing the core API phase pushes overall proper-API usage toward the 80% goal faster than advanced integrations alone
- Reduces onboarding friction for new users who primarily copy Phase 1 examples
- Ensures the infrastructure built for Phase 2 can be consumed consistently across entry-level demos

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Audit the remaining Phase 1 tests to catalog the specific interaction gaps
2. Apply existing control/event abstractions before introducing new APIs
3. Reserve new helper implementations for behaviors that appear in multiple remaining examples

- **User Value**: High ‚Äî unblocks common "bring your own tiles" and deck.gl toggling workflows

### Option B: Finish drawing wrappers (Priority 2)

5. **Documentation**: Clear examples and docstrings

### Testing Standards
1. **Unit Tests**: Test Python API logic
2. **Integration Tests**: Test generated JavaScript
3. **HTML Validation**: Verify rendered output
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing tests

### Documentation Standards
1. **Progress Reports**: One per major session
2. **API Documentation**: Update after each new API
3. **Roadmap Updates**: Keep JSON and markdown in sync
4. **Example Notebooks**: Demonstrate new APIs

## üìù Conclusion

With Phase 2 now fully complete and overall progress at 69.1%, the roadmap turns to the remaining high-impact injection hotspots. The immediate priority is to **replace the protocol and deck.gl JavaScript shims with native Python APIs**, raising Phase 3 coverage to 27.3% and unlocking PMTiles, deck.gl toggling, and custom protocol workflows for users.

Once those integrations land, finish the drawing-tool wrappers and reinvest momentum into the 13 outstanding Phase 1 demos. This cadence keeps the spotlight on visible wins while steadily marching toward the 80% proper-API usage objective and, ultimately, a zero-injection example gallery.
